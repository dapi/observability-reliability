# SRS-053 Database Monitoring & Metrics

## Definition

Database monitoring is the continuous process of tracking database health, performance, and resource utilization. It enables proactive identification of issues before they impact applications.

## Key Metrics Categories

### Connection Metrics

```
# PostgreSQL
db_connections_active (gauge)          # Active connections
db_connections_idle (gauge)            # Idle connections

db_connections_max (gauge)             # max_connections setting
db_connections_used_percent (gauge)    # Usage percentage

# Thresholds
WARNING: connections_used > 70%
CRITICAL: connections_used > 85%
```

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Current connections
SELECT state, count(*)
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY state;

-- Connection age
SELECT pid, now() - backend_start AS connection_age,
       state, query

## Alerting Rules

```yaml
groups:
  - name: database
    rules:
      # Connection alerts
      - alert: DatabaseConnectionsHigh
        expr: pg_stat_activity_count / pg_settings_max_connections > 0.7
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Database connections above 70%"

      - alert: DatabaseConnectionsCritical
        expr: pg_stat_activity_count / pg_settings_max_connections > 0.85
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical

      # Performance alerts
      - alert: SlowQueries
        expr: rate(pg_stat_statements_seconds_total[5m]) > 1
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning

      - alert: DatabaseDeadlock
        expr: increase(pg_stat_database_deadlocks[5m]) > 0
        labels:
          severity: critical

      # Storage alerts
      - alert: DatabaseDiskUsageHigh
        expr: pg_database_size_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes > 0.7
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning

      # Cache alerts
      - alert: LowCacheHitRatio
        expr: pg_stat_database_blks_hit / (pg_stat_database_blks_hit + pg_stat_database_blks_read) < 0.95
        for: 15m
        labels:
          severity: warning

      # Replication alerts
      - alert: ReplicationLagHigh
        expr: pg_replication_lag > 30
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
```

## Monitoring Tools

| Tool | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| pg_stat_statements | Query statistics | Query optimization |
| pgBadger | Log analyzer | Historical analysis |
| pg_activity | Live monitoring | Real-time debugging |
| Percona PMM | Full monitoring | Enterprise monitoring |
| DataDog | Cloud monitoring | SaaS solution |
| New Relic | APM + DB | Application correlation |

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Enable pg_stat_statements in all environments
- Set up alerting for critical metrics
- Create dashboards for key metrics
- Retain metrics history for capacity planning
- Correlate DB metrics with application metrics
- Monitor both aggregate and per-query metrics
- Track slow query trends over time

**Don't:**
- Ignore cache hit ratio degradation
- Skip connection pool monitoring
- Forget to monitor disk space
- Over-alert on temporary spikes
- Ignore index usage statistics
- Skip lock monitoring
