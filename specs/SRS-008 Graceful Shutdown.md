# SRS-014 Graceful Shutdown

To guarantee data consistency, resource management and system reliability, a service must be able to shut down gracefully.

1. Stop accepting new requests: the service must stop accepting new incoming traffic, but continue processing current requests.
2. Complete processing of active requests: complete all current tasks, including transactions, database writes, or communication with other services.
3. Notification to other services: write to log about the reasons for termination (SIGINT signal or others).
4. Resource release: properly release resources such as file descriptors, database connections, and network connections.
